# Handless

**A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.**

Handless is a cross-platform desktop application that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field. This happens on your own computer without sending any information to the cloud.

Forked from [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy) v0.7.8.

## Why Handless?

- **Free**: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone's hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source**: Together we can build further. Extend Handless for yourself and contribute to something bigger
- **Private**: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud
- **Simple**: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box

Handless isn't trying to be the best speech-to-text app -- it's trying to be the most forkable one.

## How It Works

1. **Press** a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)
2. **Speak** your words while the shortcut is active
3. **Release** and Handless processes your speech using Whisper
4. **Get** your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you're using

The process is entirely local:

- Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero
- Transcription uses your choice of models:
  - **Whisper models** (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available
  - **Parakeet V3** - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/elwin/handless/releases)
2. Install the application
3. Launch Handless and grant necessary system permissions (microphone, accessibility)
4. Configure your preferred keyboard shortcuts in Settings
5. Start transcribing!

### Development Setup

For detailed build instructions including platform-specific requirements, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture

Handless is built as a Tauri application combining:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `whisper-rs`: Local speech recognition with Whisper models
  - `transcription-rs`: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models
  - `cpal`: Cross-platform audio I/O
  - `vad-rs`: Voice Activity Detection
  - `rdev`: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events
  - `rubato`: Audio resampling

### Debug Mode

Handless includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:

- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D`

### CLI Parameters

Handless supports command-line flags for controlling a running instance and customizing startup behavior. These work on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux).

**Remote control flags** (sent to an already-running instance via the single-instance plugin):

```bash
handless --toggle-transcription    # Toggle recording on/off
handless --toggle-post-process     # Toggle recording with post-processing on/off
handless --cancel                  # Cancel the current operation
```

**Startup flags:**

```bash
handless --start-hidden            # Start without showing the main window
handless --no-tray                 # Start without the system tray icon
handless --debug                   # Enable debug mode with verbose logging
handless --help                    # Show all available flags
```

Flags can be combined for autostart scenarios:

```bash
handless --start-hidden --no-tray
```

> **macOS tip:** When Handless is installed as an app bundle, invoke the binary directly:
>
> ```bash
> /Applications/Handless.app/Contents/MacOS/Handless --toggle-transcription
> ```

## Known Issues & Current Limitations

This project is actively being developed and has some [known issues](https://github.com/elwin/handless/issues). We believe in transparency about the current state:

### Major Issues (Help Wanted)

**Whisper Model Crashes:**

- Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)
- Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent
  - If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!

**Wayland Support (Linux):**

- Limited support for Wayland display server
- Requires [`wtype`](https://github.com/atx/wtype) or [`dotool`](https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/) for text input to work correctly (see [Linux Notes](#linux-notes) below for installation)

### Linux Notes

**Text Input Tools:**

For reliable text input on Linux, install the appropriate tool for your display server:

| Display Server | Recommended Tool | Install Command                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| X11            | `xdotool`        | `sudo apt install xdotool`                         |
| Wayland        | `wtype`          | `sudo apt install wtype`                           |
| Both           | `dotool`         | `sudo apt install dotool` (requires `input` group) |

- **X11**: Install `xdotool` for both direct typing and clipboard paste shortcuts
- **Wayland**: Install `wtype` (preferred) or `dotool` for text input to work correctly
- **dotool setup**: Requires adding your user to the `input` group: `sudo usermod -aG input $USER` (then log out and back in)

Without these tools, Handless falls back to enigo which may have limited compatibility, especially on Wayland.

**Other Notes:**

- **Runtime library dependency (`libgtk-layer-shell.so.0`)**:
  - Handless links `gtk-layer-shell` on Linux. If startup fails with `error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-layer-shell.so.0`, install the runtime package for your distro:

    | Distro        | Package to install    | Example command                        |
    | ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | Ubuntu/Debian | `libgtk-layer-shell0` | `sudo apt install libgtk-layer-shell0` |
    | Fedora/RHEL   | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo dnf install gtk-layer-shell`     |
    | Arch Linux    | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo pacman -S gtk-layer-shell`       |

  - For building from source on Ubuntu/Debian, you may also need `libgtk-layer-shell-dev`.

- The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (`Overlay Position: None`) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. When the overlay is visible it can steal focus, which prevents Handless from pasting back into the application that triggered transcription. If you enable the overlay anyway, be aware that clipboard-based pasting might fail or end up in the wrong window.
- If you are having trouble with the app, running with the environment variable `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` may help
- **Global keyboard shortcuts (Wayland):** On Wayland, system-level shortcuts must be configured through your desktop environment or window manager. Use the [CLI flags](#cli-parameters) as the command for your custom shortcut.

  **GNOME:**
  1. Open **Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**
  2. Click the **+** button to add a new shortcut
  3. Set the **Name** to `Toggle Handless Transcription`
  4. Set the **Command** to `handless --toggle-transcription`
  5. Click **Set Shortcut** and press your desired key combination (e.g., `Super+O`)

  **KDE Plasma:**
  1. Open **System Settings > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**
  2. Click **Edit > New > Global Shortcut > Command/URL**
  3. Name it `Toggle Handless Transcription`
  4. In the **Trigger** tab, set your desired key combination
  5. In the **Action** tab, set the command to `handless --toggle-transcription`

  **Sway / i3:**

  Add to your config file (`~/.config/sway/config` or `~/.config/i3/config`):

  ```ini
  bindsym $mod+o exec handless --toggle-transcription
  ```

  **Hyprland:**

  Add to your config file (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`):

  ```ini
  bind = $mainMod, O, exec, handless --toggle-transcription
  ```

- You can also manage global shortcuts outside of Handless via Unix signals, which lets Wayland window managers or other hotkey daemons keep ownership of keybindings:

  | Signal    | Action                                    | Example                   |
  | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
  | `SIGUSR2` | Toggle transcription                      | `pkill -USR2 -n handless` |
  | `SIGUSR1` | Toggle transcription with post-processing | `pkill -USR1 -n handless` |

  Example Sway config:

  ```ini
  bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handless
  bindsym $mod+p exec pkill -USR1 -n handless
  ```

  `pkill` here simply delivers the signal -- it does not terminate the process.

### Platform Support

- **macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)**
- **x64 Windows**
- **x64 Linux**

### System Requirements/Recommendations

The following are recommendations for running Handless on your own machine. If you don't meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.

**For Whisper Models:**

- **macOS**: M series Mac, Intel Mac
- **Windows**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- **Linux**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
  - Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04

**For Parakeet V3 Model:**

- **CPU-only operation** - runs on a wide variety of hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors
- **Performance**: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)
- **Automatic language detection** - no manual language selection required

## Troubleshooting

### Manual Model Installation (For Proxy Users or Network Restrictions)

If you're behind a proxy, firewall, or in a restricted network environment where Handless cannot download models automatically, you can manually download and install them. The URLs are publicly accessible from any browser.

#### Step 1: Find Your App Data Directory

1. Open Handless settings
2. Navigate to the **About** section
3. Copy the "App Data Directory" path shown there, or use the shortcuts:
   - **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D` to open debug menu
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D` to open debug menu

The typical paths are:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.handless.app/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\com.handless.app\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/com.handless.app/`

#### Step 2: Create Models Directory

Inside your app data directory, create a `models` folder if it doesn't already exist:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.handless.app/models

# Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:APPDATA\com.handless.app\models"
```

#### Step 3: Download Model Files

Download the models you want from below

**Whisper Models (single .bin files):**

- Small (487 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-small.bin`
- Medium (492 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/whisper-medium-q4_1.bin`
- Turbo (1600 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin`
- Large (1100 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin`

**Parakeet Models (compressed archives):**

- V2 (473 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v2-int8.tar.gz`
- V3 (478 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v3-int8.tar.gz`

#### Step 4: Install Models

**For Whisper Models (.bin files):**

Simply place the `.bin` file directly into the `models` directory:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── ggml-small.bin
├── whisper-medium-q4_1.bin
├── ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin
└── ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin
```

**For Parakeet Models (.tar.gz archives):**

1. Extract the `.tar.gz` file
2. Place the **extracted directory** into the `models` folder
3. The directory must be named exactly as follows:
   - **Parakeet V2**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8`
   - **Parakeet V3**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8`

Final structure should look like:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
│   ├── (model files)
│   └── (config files)
└── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
    ├── (model files)
    └── (config files)
```

**Important Notes:**

- For Parakeet models, the extracted directory name **must** match exactly as shown above
- Do not rename the `.bin` files for Whisper models -- use the exact filenames from the download URLs
- After placing the files, restart Handless to detect the new models

#### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Restart Handless
2. Open Settings -> Models
3. Your manually installed models should now appear as "Downloaded"
4. Select the model you want to use and test transcription

### Custom Whisper Models

Handless can auto-discover custom Whisper GGML models placed in the `models` directory. This is useful for users who want to use fine-tuned or community models not included in the default model list.

**How to use:**

1. Obtain a Whisper model in GGML `.bin` format (e.g., from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?search=whisper%20ggml))
2. Place the `.bin` file in your `models` directory (see paths above)
3. Restart Handless to discover the new model
4. The model will appear in the "Custom Models" section of the Models settings page

**Important:**

- Community models are user-provided and may not receive troubleshooting assistance
- The model must be a valid Whisper GGML format (`.bin` file)
- Model name is derived from the filename (e.g., `my-custom-model.bin` -> "My Custom Model")

### How to Contribute

1. **Check existing issues** at [github.com/elwin/handless/issues](https://github.com/elwin/handless/issues)
2. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
3. **Test thoroughly** on your target platform
4. **Submit a pull request** with clear description of changes

The goal is to create both a useful tool and a foundation for others to build upon -- a well-patterned, simple codebase that serves the community.
